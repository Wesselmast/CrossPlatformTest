############ WELCOME TO THE TODO FOR THIS PROJECT ############

Priorities (in order):
- Remove the leftover leaks
- Make mesh / materials have their own way of getting cleaned up. They should be independant from the renderer component
- Look at the light system, it's still a bit reminiscent from the entity system
- Make other objects like lights and cameras be actors as well by turning them into components
  - A camera, for instance, would just be an actor with just a camera and a transform component
- gl_tick should just tick the renderercomponents, other components should be ticked in app_tick (I think?!)

- Make 2d perlin with octaves
- Generate colormap for terrain
- Modifying terrain based on user input

- Importing meshes
- 2D texturing meshes

- 2D rendering component
- UI system
- Gizmos

########################### IDEAS ############################

For caching the materials, meshes and later textures and other assets, I could add a parent 'asset' struct.
The openglstate would then hold a data structure filled with unique assets. 
When calling functions like mesh_cube(), it doesn't run the code again or allocate more memory.
It instead searches if it was already added to this data structure.

This does mean that the openglstate has to be passed to all the assets

It would also be cool to have a data structure that somehow searches for unique types
This way the components system (and upcoming asset system) don't need string identifiers.

#################### GOAL OF THE PROJECT #####################

I really want to make something like this. 
Creating cities and countries on a terrain based on a couple of parameters.
