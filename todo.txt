############ WELCOME TO THE TODO FOR THIS PROJECT ############

Priorities (in order):
- Remove the leftover leaks
- Make mesh / materials have their own way of getting cleaned up. They should be independant from the renderer component
- Look at the light system, it's still a bit reminiscent from the entity system
- Make other objects like lights and cameras be actors as well by turning them into components
  - A camera, for instance, would just be an actor with just a camera and a transform component
- gl_tick should just tick the renderercomponents, other components should be ticked in app_tick (I think)

- Make 2d perlin with octaves
- Generate colormap for terrain
- Modifying terrain based on user input

- Importing meshes
- 2D texturing meshes

- 2D rendering component
- UI system
- Gizmos

I really want to make something like this. 
Creating cities and countries on a terrain based on a couple of parameters.
