############ WELCOME TO THE TODO FOR THIS PROJECT ############

Priorities (in order):
- Cube normals are obviously wrong. Look into lighting tomorrow by passing it as a global uniform
- Sometimes input lags because of framerate issues. This can be because it's not desync. Look into this (linux only issue)
- Find or make a heightmap that's at least 4k for neat pictures
- Painting the terrain vertices
- Importing textures
- Importing meshes

#################### GOAL OF THE PROJECT #####################

I really want to make something like this. 
Creating cities and countries on a terrain based on a couple of parameters.
