############ WELCOME TO THE TODO FOR THIS PROJECT ############

Priorities (in order):
- Sometimes input lags because of framerate issues. This can be because it's not desync. Look into this (linux only issue)
- Cube normals are obviously wrong. Look into passing light positions as a global uniform
- Add support for PBR lighting & multiple lights
- Importing textures
- Generating terrain via user input instead of 
- Importing meshes

Creating cities and countries on a terrain based on a couple of parameters.
