############ WELCOME TO THE TODO FOR THIS PROJECT ############

Priorities (in order):
- Remove the leftover leaks
- Make mesh / materials have their own way of getting cleaned up. They should be independant from the renderer component
- Look at the light system, it's still a bit reminiscent from the entity system

- Make 2d perlin with octaves
- Generate colormap for terrain
- Modifying terrain based on user input

- Importing meshes
- Texturing meshes

Creating cities and countries on a terrain based on a couple of parameters.
